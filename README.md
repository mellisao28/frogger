Frogger Game
===================================================
How to play:
- The goal of this game is to collect as many items on the road to increase your score. All items will have the same score weight; i.e. 1. Unfortunately, this road is also heavily used by brown bugs and you need to avoid these bugs while collecting the treasure. Any collision with the brown bugs will decrease your score by 1 and reset your position.
- Every now and then there will be a stone blocking the road. Both, you (player) and brown bugs won't be able to go over the stone. This works to your advantage if the rock blocks the bugs for a while so that you can move around more freely.
- If you need to pause and unpause during the game you can press 'p'.
- And my last advice...be careful not falling to water, this will decrease your score and reset your position.

Enjoy!
