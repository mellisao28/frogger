How to play
------------

- The goal of this game is to collect as many items on the road to increase your score. All items will have the same score weight; i.e. 1. Unfortunately, this road is also a busy road and heavily used by brown bugs and you need to avoid these bugs while collecting the treasure. Any collision with the brown bugs will decrease your score by 1 and reset your position.
- Every now and then there will be a stone blocking the road. Both, you (player) and brown bugs won't be able to go over the stone. This works to your advantage if the rock blocks the bugs for a while so that you can move around more freely.
- If you need to pause and unpause during the game you can press 'p'.
- And my last advice...be careful not to fall into water, this will decrease your score and reset your position.

Enjoy!
